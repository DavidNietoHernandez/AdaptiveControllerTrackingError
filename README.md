# AdaptiveControllerTrackingError
In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have evolved from a passive to an active rol in plentiful applications. Hence, it is necessary to consider new ways to fly in order to accomplish new tasks such as grasping, sensing, and others. This paper considers a tilting quad-rotor configuration which improves the flying performance. However, this new configuration requires more robust and advanced controllers for proper operation. In this way, this paper presents the mathematical model for a  displacement in one plane of a tilt rotor quadrotor obtained via the Euler-Lagrange formulation. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive control technique is based on combined error tracking. Additionally, the closed-loop stability is obtained by a Lyapunov analysis. Finally, some numerical examples have been considered in order to evaluate and validate the control strategy.
